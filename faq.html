	    <dt>Its a bit quiet in there?</dt>
	    <dd>Its a new room, it has busy times and empty times, if you just sit around idle, an intesting conversation will pop up eventually.</dd>
	  </dl>

	  <dl>
	    <dt>Hasnt this been done before?</dt>
	    <dd>Yeh, but I never really any rooms that I really enjoyed the conversation in, its not to replace irc, whic
	      is always going to be the first place to go for topical help.</dd>
	  </dl>

	  <dl>
	    <dt>How private is the chat?</dt>
	    <dd>Not very, we are talking about having the logs public as it might be a source of help to others with the same questions, theres are also
	      bots that may log messages etc. If you dont want your real name shown in searches related to the site, use a different name to sign on, but its
	      best to generally avoid talking about things you wouldnt want your mum to read. </dd>
	  </dl>


	  <dl>
	    <dt>Whats with the referral, where does the money go?</dt>
	    <dd>Right now econnrefused is on my vps hosting account, If it can sustain its own hosting, then I will be able to open the account and give out passwords
	      to anyone who needs it. Then people will be free to host other community sites / write jabber plugins or just even use the server for testing new projects.</dd>
